# BanglaScholar Web

## Problem
Bangladeshi students often miss scholarships due to scattered information, language barriers, and lack of official links. This makes access to higher education opportunities unequal.

## Solution
A web platform that:
- Lists scholarships for Bangladeshi students
- Provides deadlines, official links, and short descriptions
- Easy-to-read Bangla interface
- Front-end design ready, backend integration in progress

## Impact
Helps students find opportunities quickly, reduces confusion, and improves access to education resources across Bangladesh.
